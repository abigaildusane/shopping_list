### Description  
A simple shopping list tool where users can add items, mark them as bought, and clear the list.  
This helped me explore list data structures, event handling, and basic user interface logic.

---

### What I Learned  
- How to manage lists (adding and removing items)  
- Event-driven logic (clicks and user inputs)  
- Creating simple UI states (bought vs. not bought)

---

### Future Improvements  
- Save the list between sessions  
- Add categories or price tags  
- Export or print the list
