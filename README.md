### Description  
A simple shopping list tool where users can add items, mark them as bought, and clear the list.  
It helped me explore list data structures, event handling, and UI logic.

---

### What I Learned  
- Managing lists (adding/removing items)  
- Event-driven logic (clicks, inputs)  
- UI feedback in Snap! (visual states for bought/unbought items)

---

### Future Improvements  
- Save the list between sessions  
- Add categories or price tags  
- Export or print the list
